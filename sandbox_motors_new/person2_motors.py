"""  # DONE: 1. PUT YOUR NAME IN THE ABOVE LINE.

# TODO: 2. Implement spin_left_seconds, then the relevant part of the test function.
#          Test and correct as needed.
#   Then repeat for spin_left_by_time.
#   Then repeat for spin_left_by_encoders.
#   Then repeat for the spin_right functions.

      1. Repeatedly:
          -- Prompts for and gets input from the console for:
             -- Seconds to travel
                  -- If this is 0, BREAK out of the loop.
             -- Speed at which to travel (-100 to 100)
             -- Stop action ("brake", "coast" or "hold")
          -- Makes the robot run per the above.
      2. Same as #1, but gets degrees and runs spin_left_by_time.
      3. Same as #2, but runs spin_left_by_encoders.
      4. Same as #1, 2, 3, but tests the spin_right functions.
